// JS is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language
// high-level - which means that we don't have to think how to managing the computer's memory while it runs or program, there are a lot of so-called abstractions over all these small details that we don't want to worry about. And this makes the language a lot easier to write and to learn.

// multi-paradigm -  we can use all kinds of different programming styles, such as imperative and declarative programming

// HTML - CSS - JS
// Content - Presentation - Building web applications
// Nouns - Adjectives - Verbs

// JS - dynamic effects and web apps in the browser, Front-end
   // - web-app on web-servers                     , Back-end

let js = 'amazing';
if (js === 'amazing') {
  // alert ('JS is Fun')
  console.log('JS is Fun');
} 

console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10);  //61
