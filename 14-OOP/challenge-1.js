// Coding Challenge #1

/* 
1. Use a constructor function to implement a Car. A car has a make and a speed property. The speed property is the current speed of the car in km/h;
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console;
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console;
4. Create 2 car objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.

DATA CAR 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
DATA CAR 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

/* 
1. Re-create challenge 1, but this time using an ES6 class;
2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide by 1.6);
3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6);
4. Create a new car and experiment with the accelerate and brake methods, and with the getter and setter.

/* 
1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called EV) as a CHILD "class" of Car. Besides a make and current speed, the EV also has the current battery charge in % ('charge' property);
2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument 'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo';
3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20, and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140 km/h, with a charge of 22%';
4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate', 'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when you 'accelerate'! HINT: Review the definiton of polymorphism ðŸ˜‰
